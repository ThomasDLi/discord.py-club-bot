# discord.py-club-bot
Some simple lines of code that allows Admins to create, and users to join, leave, and ping clubs without the need of a txt file.

This aint a whole bot. Just giving you the code to paste into your existing bot.

To create a club, simply create a role called "club: exampleclub" (replace the exampleclub with club name of your choice) and users can immediatly "!joinclub exampleclub", "!leaveclub exampleclub", or "!pingclub exampleclub"
