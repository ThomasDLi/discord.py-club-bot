# discord.py-club-bot
Some simple lines of code that allows Admins to create, and users to join, leave, and ping clubs without the need of a txt file to store club information.

This aint a whole bot. Just giving you the code to paste into your existing bot.

TO CONFIGURE, INSERT THE CHANNEL ID OF A DESTINED CLUBINFO CHANNEL INTO THE SPACE PROVIDED ON LINE 25 OF CODE. WHEN YOU CREATE A CLUB, IT WILL POST A MESSAGE THERE WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CLUB AND THE NAME OF THE CLUB, LETTING USERS KNOW THAT THE CLUB EXISTS AND WHAT THE CLUB IS ABOUT.

To create a club, simply do "!createclub (clubname) (club description)" i.e. "!createclub test a test club" which will create a club with the name of "test" and the description of "a test club"
